# Information-Theoretic Anomaly Detection

A novel approach to anomaly detection in high-dimensional data using information theory principles.

## Overview
This project explores a comprehensive framework incorporating multiple uncertainty metrics beyond standard entropy for anomaly detection. The approach adapts established information-theoretic principles to create practical anomaly detection solutions that outperform traditional methods, particularly in high-dimensional spaces.

## Features
- Data preprocessing with standardization and dimensionality reduction
- Learning probability distributions using histogram-based and kernel density approximations
- Computing a comprehensive set of information-theoretic anomaly scores
- Establishing adaptive thresholds for anomaly classification

## Dataset
The project uses the KDD Cup 1999 network intrusion detection dataset.
